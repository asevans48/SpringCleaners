A tool for cleaning XML and Spring XML configuration files. The tool does not currently have documen
tation so the intended audience are myself and people who can write code until then. Using Spring da
ta structures and the util:map it is possible to add,create,destroy, and overwrite properties,struct
ures, beans, and nodes. XMLCleaner is for XML and SpringBeanCleaner is for Spring. The program uses
the directories list to populate a list of files and then multi-threadedly processes them via Scala.
All dependencies are in Maven Scala XML and javax XML are used to 'clean' the XML.

Again sorry for the lack of documentation as I am quite busy but it should be possible to generate a
 javadoc complete with comments.
